# My HTB writeups during the journey to OSCP

## About me

The original goal was to become a network engineer but during college I was introduced to penetration testing, a field that I am passionate about since then. My main interests are web application penetration testing, file system forensics and privilege escalation mostly on Linux environments. Currently I have completed 18 machines and working on publishing all my writeups as soon as possible.
